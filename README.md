brython
=======

Brython (Browser Python) is an implementation of Python 3 running in the
browser, with an interface to the DOM elements and events.

Here is a simple example of an HTML page running Python:

```html
<html>

    <head>
        <script src="/path/to/brython.js"></script>
    </head>

    <body>

        <script type="text/python">
        from browser import bind, document, alert

        @bind(document['mybutton'], 'click')
        def echo(event):
            alert(document["zone"].value)
        </script>

        <input id="zone"><button id="mybutton">click !</button>

    </body>

</html>
```

To use Brython, all there is to do is:

1. Load the script [brython.js](http://brython.info/src/brython.js "Brython from the site brython.info").
2. Write Python code inside tags `<script type="text/python">`.


Main features
=============
Brython supports the syntax of [Python 3](https://www.python.org "Python Homepage"),
and the modules of the CPython distribution written in Python, except for the
features that are not relevant in the browser context (writing on disk for
instance).

Since version 3.8.0, Brython implements the Python version of the same major /
minor version number.

It includes libraries to interact with DOM elements and events,
and with existing Javascript libraries such as jQuery, D3, Highcharts, Raphael etc.
It supports the latest specs of HTML5/CSS3, and can use CSS Frameworks like
Bootstrap3, LESS, SASS etc.


Getting started
===============
Zero install !
--------------
The most simple way to get started, without anything to install, is to use the
distribution available online through [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/).
You can choose the latest stable release :

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/brython@3.14.0/brython.min.js">
</script>
```

The previous code will allow you to use raw python code, but if you import
modules from the standard library you have to load a single javascript file
with the [available stdlib](https://github.com/brython-dev/brython/tree/master/www/src/Lib):

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/brython@3.14.0/brython_stdlib.js">
</script>
```

jsDelivr supports version ranges, so if you want the latest of the
3.14.x versions:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/brython@3.14/brython.min.js">
</script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/brython@3.14/brython_stdlib.js">
</script>
```

or the latest of the 3.x.y versions:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/brython@3/brython.min.js">
</script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/brython@3/brython_stdlib.js">
</script>
```

If you want to use the latest development version, you can load these scripts
instead:
```html
<script src="https://raw.githack.com/brython-dev/brython/master/www/src/brython.js"
        crossorigin="anonymous">
</script>
<script src="https://raw.githack.com/brython-dev/brython/master/www/src/brython_stdlib.js"
        crossorigin="anonymous">
</script>
```

Local install
-------------
To install Brython locally, if you have a CPython distribution with `pip` :

```bash
pip install brython
```

then create a new directory and run

```bash
brython-cli install
```

or by loading the latest version of the Brython zip file from the
[releases page](https://github.com/brython-dev/brython/releases).

In both cases, the distribution includes __brython.js__ (the core Brython engine)
and __brython_stdlib.js__ (a bundle of all the files in the standard distribution).

It also includes the page __demo.html__ that shows a few examples of how you
can interact with a web page using Python as the scripting language : create
new elements, access and modify existing elements, create graphics, animations,
send Ajax requests, etc.
